Paper 1:

Near linear time algorithm to detect community structures in large-scale networks.

Description:

Community detection and analysis is an important methodology for understanding the organization of various real-world networks. In this paper, the researchers have explained a simple label propagation algorithm that uses the network structure alone as its guide and will not require any prior information about the communities. The algorithm is validated by applying it to networks whose community structures are already known. Since, this algorithm takes an almost linear time, it is computationally less expensive.

Paper 2:

An Evaluation of Community Detection Algorithms on Large-Scale Email Traffic.

Description:

In this paper, large-scale email networks are used to evaluate experimentally the qualitative performance of several community detection algorithms. A number of structural quality functions and a logical quality measure is used to compare the quality of the algorithms so as to separate ham and spam emails by clustering them into distinct communities.

Result: The algorithm that performs link community detection is more suitable for clustering email networks than the node-based approaches, and it creates more distinct communities of ham and spam edges.

Paper 3:

Community detection algorithms: a comparative analysis

Description:

In this paper, there are three recent algorithms introduced by Rosvall and Bergstrom, Blondel et al. and Ronhovde and Nussinov, respectively, which have an excellent performance with the additional advantage of low computational complexity, which enables one to analyze large systems.

Paper 4:

Community Detection in Networks with Node Attributes

Description:

Community detection algorithms traditionally focus only on the network structure, while clustering algorithms mostly consider only node attributes. The authors of this paper have developed Communities from Edge Structure and Node Attributes, an accurate and scalable algorithm for detecting overlapping communities in networks with node attributes.
