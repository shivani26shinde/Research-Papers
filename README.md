Paper 1:
Near linear time algorithm to detect community structures in large-scale networks.
Description:
Community detection and analysis is an important methodology for understanding the organization of various real-world networks. In this paper, the researchers have explained a simple label propagation algorithm that uses the network structure alone as its guide and will not require any prior information about the communities. The algorithm is validated by applying it to networks whose community structures are already known. Since, this algorithm takes an almost linear time, it is computationally less expensive.
