Paper 1:

Near linear time algorithm to detect community structures in large-scale networks.

Description:

Community detection and analysis is an important methodology for understanding the organization of various real-world networks. In this paper, the researchers have explained a simple label propagation algorithm that uses the network structure alone as its guide and will not require any prior information about the communities. The algorithm is validated by applying it to networks whose community structures are already known. Since, this algorithm takes an almost linear time, it is computationally less expensive.

Paper 2:

An Evaluation of Community Detection Algorithms on Large-Scale Email Traffic.

Description:

In this paper, large-scale email networks are used to evaluate experimentally the qualitative performance of several community detection algorithms. A number of structural quality functions and a logical quality measure is used to compare the quality of the algorithms so as to separate ham and spam emails by clustering them into distinct communities.

Result: The algorithm that performs link community detection is more suitable for clustering email networks than the node-based approaches, and it creates more distinct communities of ham and spam edges.

Paper 3:

Community detection algorithms: a comparative analysis

Description:

In this paper, there are three recent algorithms introduced by Rosvall and Bergstrom, Blondel et al. and Ronhovde and Nussinov, respectively, which have an excellent performance with the additional advantage of low computational complexity, which enables one to analyze large systems.

Paper 4:

Community Detection in Networks with Node Attributes

Description:

Community detection algorithms traditionally focus only on the network structure, while clustering algorithms mostly consider only node attributes. The authors of this paper, have developed Communities from Edge Structure and Node Attributes, an accurate and scalable algorithm for detecting overlapping communities in networks with node attributes. This algorithm models the interaction between the network structure and the node attributes, which leads to more accurate community detection, has a linear runtime in the network size and helps with the interpretation of detected communities by finding relevant node attributes for each community.

Paper 5: 

Homophily in Social Networks

Description:

The homophily principle structures network ties of every type, including marriage, friendship, work, advice, support, information transfer, exchange, comembership, and other types of relationship. Homophily limits people’s social worlds in a way that has powerful implications for the information they receive, the attitudes they form, and the interactions they experience.

This paper discusses the following topics:

(a) the basic ecological processes that link organizations, associations, cultural communities, social movements, and many other social forms 

(b) the impact of multiplex ties on the patterns of homophily and 

(c) the dynamics of network change over time through which networks and other social entities co-evolve

Paper 6:

Small World Problem

Description:

Milgram's experiment developed out of a desire to learn more about the probability that two randomly selected people would know each other. Another view of the problem is to imagine the population as a social network and attempt to find the average path length between any two nodes. Milgram's experiment was designed to measure these path lengths by developing a procedure to count the number of ties between any two people.

Paper 7:

Weak Ties

Description:

The research in this paper talks about the importance of weak ties. In terms of connection with general society and staying in touch with what is going on in the wider world, the weak ties with our acquaintances are paradoxically much more important than the inwardly-focused conversations with our closer friends. The more weak ties we have, the more connected to the world we are and are more likely to receive important information about ideas, threats and opportunities in time to respond to them. Researchers have discovered that information about jobs that led to employment were more likely to come from the weak ties with acquaintances than from closer friends.

Paper 8:
 
Key Players in Social Networks

Description:

The optimal selection of key players depends on the following two goals:

1. KPP-POS - It is defined as the identification of key players for the purpose of optimally diffusing something through the network by using the key players as seeds.

2. KPP-NEG - It is defined as the identification of key players for the purpose of disrupting or fragmenting the network by removing the key nodes.
